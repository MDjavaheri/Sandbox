Rock, Paper, Scissors!
=====
A fun RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors) game to play in the browser.
### Three Ways To Play:
1. Random: Let the computer randomly decide on a move
2. Most Popular Move: The computer plays the counter to your most popular move
3. Last Move: The computer plays the counter to your last move
### Frameworks
Implemented primarily using regular Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
Underscore.js used minimally for the Most Popular Move Strategy.
Unit testing with QUnit.

### Future Updates:
1. More taunting computer messages and graphics
2. Mac vs. PC
3. SuperPsuedo Random Popular Move Mode: The computer picks randomly from your history of moves
4. Less Predictable Mode: The Computer realizes it's losing to the same move in either Mode's 2 or 3 and switches to something else.
